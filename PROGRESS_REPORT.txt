# EduCareTrack Progress Report
Date: 2026-01-27

## Executive Summary
EduCareTrack has reached an estimated 85% completion status. The core modules (Parent, Teacher, Guard, Clinic, Admin) are integrated with Supabase, featuring real-time data synchronization, role-based access control (RBAC), and enhanced notification systems.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Real-time Attendance & Tracking
- **Supabase Integration**: Migrated from Firebase to Supabase for all core modules.
- **Real-time Channels**: Implemented `postgres_changes` listeners for instant UI updates across all dashboards without page reloads.
- **Guard Module**: 
  - QR Code Scanner integrated with Supabase.
  - Manual Entry support with "Manual Entry" notifications.
  - Real-time dashboard updates for check-ins/outs.

### 2. Clinic Management Integration
- **Digital Clinic Pass**: Teachers can issue digital passes; Clinic staff can scan student QR codes for check-in/out.
- **Medical Assessment**: Clinic staff can record findings, treatments, and recommendations.
- **Notifications**: Automated notifications to Parents and Homeroom Teachers upon clinic check-in/out.
- **Data Integration**: Clinic visits are linked to student attendance status (e.g., "In Clinic").

### 3. Parent Portal
- **Color-Coded Calendar**: Monthly view with status indicators (Green=Present, Yellow=Late, Red=Absent).
- **Real-time Sync**: Calendar updates instantly when attendance or clinic status changes.
- **Excuse Letters**: Parents can upload excuse letters (Picture/PDF) for absences.

### 4. Admin Analytics
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of attendance trends, status distributions, and clinic visit statistics.
- **Sorting & Filtering**: Enhanced tables with sorting capabilities for deep data analysis.
- **Data Normalization**: Unified data structure for consistent reporting.

## Technical Improvements
- **Schema Alignment**: Verified and aligned code with Supabase database schema (e.g., `notifications`, `clinic_visits`).
- **Performance**: Implemented parallel data fetching and 5-minute caching for student data to reduce database load.
- **Robustness**: Added error handling, duplicate scan prevention, and offline grace handling.

## Remaining Tasks (Next Steps)
1. **Testing**: Conduct end-to-end testing of the full user flow (Parent -> Guard -> Teacher -> Clinic -> Admin).
2. **Edge Cases**: Verify behavior for "Half Day" and complex attendance scenarios.
3. **UI Polish**: Finalize CSS styling for consistency across modules.
4. **Documentation**: Create user guides for each role.

## Schema Verification Status
- **Notifications**: Aligned (`target_users`, `read_by`, `type`).
- **Clinic Visits**: Aligned (`treated_by`, `visit_time`, `outcome`).
- **Attendance**: Aligned (`student_id`, `class_id`, `status`, `method`).

## Conclusion
The system is functionally complete for core requirements. Focus now shifts to stability testing and deployment preparation.
