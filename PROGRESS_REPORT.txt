EDUCARETRACK PROGRESS REPORT
Date: January 26, 2026
Status: 80% Deployable / Feature Complete for Core Real-time Modules

1. SUMMARY OF ACHIEVEMENTS
--------------------------
We have successfully implemented a fully interconnected, real-time attendance and clinic management system. The system now supports role-based access control (RBAC) and instant data synchronization across all user modules (Parent, Teacher, Guard, Clinic, Admin).

2. COMPLETED FEATURES
---------------------
[x] Real-time Data Synchronization (Supabase Channels)
    - Attendance updates from Guard triggers instant UI refreshes for Parents, Teachers, and Admins.
    - Clinic status changes ("In Clinic" / "Checked Out") update Parent calendars and Teacher dashboards immediately.
    - Admin analytics charts update live without page reloads.

[x] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Data Scoping
    - Parents: See only their own children's data.
    - Teachers: See only their assigned homeroom class.
    - Clinic: Sees all students but manages health records.
    - Guards: optimized for quick entry/exit logging.
    - Admins: Global oversight with full filtering and sorting capabilities.

[x] Module-Specific Enhancements
    - Parent Module: 
        * Color-coded monthly calendar (Green/Yellow/Red).
        * Real-time "In Clinic" status indicators.
        * Excuse letter submission with teacher notifications.
    - Guard Module:
        * QR Scanner integration with medical assessment triggers.
        * Manual entry fallback.
        * Auto-notifications to parents/teachers upon scan.
    - Teacher Module:
        * Real-time analytics dashboard (Attendance + Clinic).
        * Manual attendance override.
        * Clinic pass generation.
    - Clinic Module:
        * Digital check-in/out workflow.
        * Detailed health reports and trend analysis (Reasons, Daily Volume).
    - Admin Module:
        * Centralized record view with sorting (Time, Name, Reason, Status).
        * Global analytics and CSV export.

3. RECENT TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------------
- Implemented parallel data fetching to resolve loading gaps (student names, classes).
- Added 5-minute client-side caching for static data (students list) to improve performance.
- Normalized data structures for consistent analytics across modules.
- Added "INSERT" event listeners to Teacher Dashboard to catch new arrivals instantly.
- Fixed file path and sync errors in Admin and Clinic modules.

4. NEXT STEPS (Roadmap to 100%)
-------------------------------
1. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
   - Simulate a full day cycle: Guard Check-in -> Classroom -> Clinic Visit -> Guard Check-out.
   - Verify all notifications land in the correct inboxes.

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement pagination for very large datasets (currently handled via partial loading/filtering).
   - Add database indexing for `student_id`, `class_id`, and `timestamp` columns in Supabase.

3. Mobile Responsiveness Polish:
   - Ensure complex tables (Admin/Clinic) render well on smaller mobile screens.

4. Security Hardening:
   - Review Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to strictly enforce the logic currently implemented in the frontend.

5. Final Deployment:
   - Build/Bundle assets (if moving to a build step) or finalize static hosting configuration.
